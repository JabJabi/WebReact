# ConfigAI

got bored and wanted to do some cool stuff, so there's an AI tool that allows you to make some cool pc configuration optimized by AI so you don't buy shit things, 
in the future i would like to sell or to redirect to websites that sells directly the pc components.
But fn i would like to finish that before i got demotivated lol.
