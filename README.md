# Final Goals?

It's simply for my personal knowledge and training into web development, you're free to use it or to complete it if you want.

I wish i could have a fully functional website, with a simple forum, and profiles. 
For the moment, i want to finish and to make a good frontend without problem, and compatible with any device.
